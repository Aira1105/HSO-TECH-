### **Performance Issues**

###### **KB Article: 000061991**

###### Slow startup or sluggish performance, especially on older hardware or when used with large databases.
###### Freezing or crashing during use.
###### Dentrix Performance Troubleshooting Guide
###### When did the slowing in Dentrix start? 
##### Consider the following:
##### Recent power outage?  
######  *If so, contact support when everyone has time to be out of Dentrix.* 
###### Was Dentrix fast yesterday or last week?  
###### Did the issue start after a Windows or software update?  
###### What changes were made on the computer(s), if any?  
#### Version & Updates Check
###### Are you on the latest version of Dentrix? [`How to check for Dentrix Version`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hFnF4ii50GWqLDDKIPPz0CwsYyPFy2HL/view?usp=sharing)
###### If not, follow the How To Check For Updates guide and install them. [`How to Update Dentrix`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14qXo02seDUbUWtUeAmne17NIA8iRiLLL/view?usp=sharing)

#### **Performance & System Checks**
###### Use Windows Task Manager to verify that the server CPU is not running at 100% usage. [`How to check for CPU Utilization`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OlBcoNND0W9VRFd4TYftoRbpe94K2GA5/view?usp=sharing)
###### If so, you may need to restart the server.  
#### **Check for exclusions in Antivirus or backup software running**  
###### Verify that your computers meet the minimum [System Requirements](Click here) to view current requirements.  
###### Check Server disk space on the C: drive (and the data drive, if applicable). 
###### Ensure there is at least 10% free space on the system drive (C:), where the OS and the program files for Dentrix are located.  
###### Ensure there is at least 15% free space on the data drive.  

#### Contact Support  
##### ***If the slowness issue is not resolved, please contact Support for assistance.***

Dentrix 24.19 running slow on all computers.

 

 

Workaround
Try each step below, testing after each one to see if it resolves the issue:

Restart Appointment Book on all computers.
Restart the DentrixACEServer service.
Open DBSweep.exe. Thereâ€™s no need to run itâ€”simply open and close the program. 
Reboot the server.
If these steps do not resolve the issue, proceed to  Environmental Slowness - First Level.

Steps to Duplicate
Load 24.19

Open AB and create an appt for Brent Crosby. Be sure to check the "Do not show again" on the prompts

Open Ctree Ace Monitor, and enable Auto Refresh for every 3 seconds

Note the total number of connections for SQL and ISAM

Open and close Brent's appt - no changes, click OK to close

Watch the ISAM connection count rise on each open

Slowness Checklist:
What is the full version of Dentrix currently used? 
 If already on a current year of Dentrix (ie 24.X, 25.X), proceed with the troubleshooting below. If they are not and all machines are affected, upgrade to our current version of Dentrix.  Offer to transfer them to the Dentrix Installs team to schedule.   Many slowness and WI related to performance have been resolved in our current versions. Inform the customer that the steps we perform below are a temporary fix and that the issue will return if they are not using a current version of Dentrix. 
For talking points on the advantages of upgrading, see Dentrix Automatic Updates FAQ and Links
