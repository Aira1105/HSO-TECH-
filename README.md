|![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf705712-224c-45af-87c0-03a3eecb9146)|`Procedure Code List`| *Procedure Code List contains all available dental procedure codes used for treatment planning, billing, and insurance claims. You can search for procedure codes in multiple areas, including the Patient Chart, Ledger, Appointment Book, and Procedure Code Setup. Dentrix allows users to filter codes by category or search by description to quickly locate the correct procedure. Additionally, the CDA Dental Codes List provides standard codes grouped into categories such as Diagnostic, Preventative, Restorative, Endodontics, and more*|
|![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0671983a-c307-4894-a352-4ed47beb241e)|`Dental Code List`| *Dental Code Lists provide standardized procedure codes used for treatment planning, billing, and insurance claims. The CDA Dental Codes List includes both short and full descriptions of procedures, grouped into categories such as Diagnostic, Preventative, Restorative, Endodontics, Periodontics, Prosthodontics, Oral Surgery, Orthodontics, and Adjunctive General Services. Dentrix allows users to search for procedure codes in the Patient Chart, Ledger, Appointment Book, and Procedure Code Setup, making it easier to locate the correct code for a specific treatment*|
|![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a20b5cb0-4282-4f3a-907d-8572d5686d87)|`Medical Code List`| *Medical Code List allows you to view and print medical codes entered in the system. These codes are grouped by type, including AMA CPT, ICD, Modifier, Place of Service, and Type of Service. The report helps ensure medical codes are up to date and provides a reference for ICD-9-CM codes associated with AMA CPT codes. You can generate this report in Office Manager > Reports > Reference > Medical Code List, where you can filter codes based on specific criteria. Additionally, Dentrix supports ICD-10 dental diagnosis codes, which are essential for billing medical insurance. These codes help practices comply with insurance requirements and streamline claims processing*|
|![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b63b292-be1b-42f6-a0af-bf9858d68bfd)|`Multi-Code List`| *Multi-Codes allow you to group multiple procedures into a single code, making treatment planning, scheduling, and posting more efficient. Instead of entering each procedure separately, you can use a multi-code to post several procedures with one click. Dentrix includes predefined multi-codes, but you can also create custom ones to fit your practice’s needs. To set up a multi-code, go to Office Manager, then Maintenance, followed by Practice Setup, and finally Multi-Code Setup. Click "New" to create a new multi-code, enter a description (up to 31 characters) and an abbreviation (up to 9 characters). Select an appointment type and define the procedure time. Click "Add" to include procedures in the multi-code, then save the multi-code for use in the Appointment Book, Patient Chart, or Ledger. Multi-codes help streamline workflows by ensuring that commonly grouped procedures, such as a crown and buildup, are posted together, reducing errors and saving time.*|
|![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eee48101-9f98-4d7c-a1c9-36cf64a78edc)|`Fee Schedule`| *In Dentrix, fee schedules function as comprehensive pricing catalogs for dental procedures. Each fee schedule identifies the standard fee—often known as the "usual, customary, and reasonable" (UCR) fee or sometimes the "office" or "cash" fee—for every procedure, and it allows practices to tailor these fees based on specific scenarios. For example, the fee can be adjusted to accommodate different patient situations such as insurance participation, in-office discount plans, or discounted rates for family members and employees. Dentrix offers the flexibility to assign up to 999 different fees per procedure, ensuring that every pricing scenario can be accurately addressed. When a fee schedule is not manually assigned at the patient level, Dentrix automatically determines the appropriate fee by referencing the patient’s insurance details or default provider settings. This automatic assignment process is designed to streamline billing and reduce administrative work, while still providing the ability for detailed customization when necessary. Additionally, Dentrix includes tools like the Automatic Fee Schedule Changes utility, which lets practices quickly and efficiently adjust an entire fee schedule—whether by a fixed dollar amount or a percentage—to keep pace with changes in operational costs or market rates.Dentrix also features reporting capabilities that generate detailed fee schedule reports, listing procedure codes along with their associated fees, as well as lab and material expenses. These reports offer dental professionals a clear view of the pricing structure, supporting accurate billing and financial oversight throughout the practice management process. Beyond this basic description, it’s valuable to note that Dentrix’s fee schedule functionality is integral to treatment planning and practice management. By automating many aspects of fee assignment and adjustment, Dentrix helps practices not only maintain consistent pricing in line with regional market rates but also adapt quickly to any internal or contractual changes. If you’d like to explore further, Dentrix provides additional resources that detail how to manage fee schedules effectively, integrate them with other practice management modules, and ensure that patient billing remains transparent and up-to-date.*|
|![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/132d61fb-10a4-404d-9ba4-d52a70af85a9)|`Employer List`| *The Employer List in Dentrix is a dedicated report found in the Office Manager module that consolidates all employer information from your database. It displays key details such as the employer's name, address, and phone number. Additionally, there’s an option to include a list of patients employed by each organization. This feature proves invaluable when you need to analyze patient demographics, track how employer transitions might impact insurance coverages, or simply manage and update patient records linked to specific employers. In practice, the report can be generated by navigating to Reports, then Reference, and selecting Employer List. You can define the report range by selecting either a broad alphabetical range of employers or narrowing it down to a single employer by using the same entry in both the From and To fields. When you choose to include employees, the report will also show the names and total count of patients associated with each employer. For a more interactive approach, Dentrix offers an eDex interface where you can apply filters, view additional employer details like linked insurance plans, and even access notepad fields for personal annotations.This functionality not only supports efficient record management but also assists in making informed decisions regarding practice operations, patient billing, and potential impacts of employer-based changes on your patient base.*|
|![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/beb183bf-5a18-42c5-b1fa-4c0aed94df4e)|`Insurance Carrier List`| *The Insurance Carrier List in Dentrix is a report that provides a comprehensive view of the insurance carriers entered into the system, enabling dental practices to manage and review their insurance data effectively. The report is accessed through the Office Manager’s Reports section under the Reference category where users can generate a list of insurance carriers along with selected details based on their specific needs. When generating this report, users can choose from different list types. A standard list will display the basic information for each insurance carrier, while additional options allow for including subscriber information—which typically lists the guarantors (subscribers) along with details such as their name, birth date, chart number, and other relevant data. There is also an option to generate a report that lists all insured patients for each carrier, and another option to include provider IDs that display the provider’s name and identification details. To run the report, a report date is entered (defaulting to the current date) and a range of insurance carriers is selected either by specifying a “From” and “To” selection or by opting to include all carriers. Moreover, there is a mailing labels option for printing labels for the carriers. It is important to choose list options carefully since selecting both the standard list and subscriber options simultaneously can result in two separate outputs—one showing just the carriers and the other showing carriers with subscribers. This functionality is essential for streamlining billing, identifying discrepancies in patient records, and ensuring that all insurance-related information is accurate and up to date. The comprehensive details provided by the Insurance Carrier List help practices make informed decisions regarding insurance plan administration and patient billing procedures, ultimately supporting efficient practice management.*
|![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/236825ca-34c5-4d48-b4bf-1a9ff86872d7)|`Standard Coverage Table`| *In Dentrix, the standard coverage table provides a structured framework that outlines how insurance benefits apply to various dental procedures. This table is organized by grouping ADA procedure codes into predefined ranges like Diagnostic/Preventive, Basic Restorative, and other categories. Each group typically has set parameters such as percentage coverage, deductibles, copay amounts, and, in some cases, pre-authorization requirements. These configurations are used as a baseline when processing insurance claims, ensuring that treatment estimates are consistent and that billing is streamlined. The default coverage table is central to the automated process within Dentrix. When a new insurance plan is entered, the system uses these guided proportions to predict the insurance reimbursement by referencing the procedure’s placement within the table. For instance, diagnostic and preventive services might be covered at 100%, while restorative services could be covered at a lower percentage. However, the system allows for customization, so practices may adjust these groupings or create exceptions for specific procedures. This makes it possible to tailor the coverage parameters according to the nuances of each insurance plan and the practice’s financial policies. By using the standard coverage table, Dentrix helps dental practices provide more accurate treatment estimates to their patients. It also simplifies internal management by centralizing benefit details and ensuring that any updates to a coverage plan automatically reflect across all affected patient records. This tool, integrated into the Insurance Maintenance module, aids in maintaining consistent and efficient billing practices while accommodating the complex requirements of dental insurance administration.*|
|![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76bf6e96-e21b-42b9-ab52-02b849b63cba)|`Insurance Coverage Tables`| *In Dentrix, the Insurance Coverage Tables serve as a systematic framework to define how insurance benefits apply to a wide range of dental procedures. These tables are configured by grouping ADA procedure codes into specific ranges—such as Diagnostic/Preventive, Basic Restorative, Endodontics, and more—with each group assigned default parameters like coverage percentages, deductibles, copays, and sometimes pre-authorization requirements. This structured approach enables the system to automatically determine insurance estimates based on where a given procedure falls within these predefined categories. One of the key advantages of these tables is their flexibility. Although Dentrix provides a default Coverage Table, practices can customize it based on specific insurance plan policies and unique reimbursement trends. For instance, a procedure like a full mouth series of X-rays (commonly tagged as D0210) might ordinarily be included in the Diagnostic/Preventive category, yet some insurance plans might apply different benefits, such as a deductible or a modified coverage percentage. Dentrix allows you to adjust the beginning and ending procedure codes, change the associated coverage percentages, and even add separate entries for exceptions—ensuring that the estimates generated are as accurate as possible. The integration of Insurance Coverage Tables with other components—such as fee schedules, which establish the standard charges for procedures, and payment tables, which record historical insurance payments—creates a robust system for generating precise treatment estimates. This integration not only streamlines billing and claims processing but also aids in financial oversight by ensuring that both insurance-related and out-of-pocket patient costs are accurately calculated. Ultimately, the Insurance Coverage Tables in Dentrix play a pivotal role in making sure that dental practices can reliably predict reimbursements, support transparent patient billing, and adjust quickly to changes in insurance policies and contractual terms.*|
|![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/597fa93c-fd7c-44da-8b31-5bc519e1d6d7)|`Updated Dental Insurance Payment Table`| *The Updated Dental Insurance Payment Table in Dentrix is a feature that allows practices to override the default calculation of insurance payments with a precise dollar amount determined by the insurance carrier. Instead of relying solely on the standard coverage table—which calculates payments by multiplying the fee charged for a procedure by a predetermined coverage percentage—the payment table lets you enter an exact amount that the insurance company will pay for a specific procedure. This functionality is particularly useful in situations where the standard calculation may not accurately reflect carrier-approved payments, such as when a procedure is downgraded or when negotiated rates differ from the standard fee. Dentrix integrates this table within the Dental Insurance Benefits and Coverage dialog box, offering several methods to update or maintain the payment table. You can enter payment amounts directly into the Payment Table and Allowed Amounts tab, update them as you process itemized claim payments, or use the Batch Insurance Payment Entry feature to automatically adjust the table using an update option. In essence, when a procedure has an entry in the payment table, Dentrix will disregard the standard coverage percentage calculation and instead use the precise dollar value provided, ensuring continuity and precision in future insurance estimates. It is important to note that the amount entered into the payment table is typically considered as the base payment amount, assuming that no deductible is owed. If a deductible applies, Dentrix will calculate and subtract it from the payment table amount during the claim process. This level of customization not only improves the accuracy of insurance estimates but also contributes to more consistent billing practices across the practice.*|
|![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00bace26-52c0-40da-8ed6-d9e7d0aa650c)|`Provideer IDs List`| *The Provider IDs List in Dentrix is a report designed to display detailed information about each provider and the insurance carriers for which each provider has entered a provider ID. This list is accessed through the Office Manager by navigating to the Reports menu and then selecting Reference → Provider IDs List. It serves as an essential tool for ensuring that the correct provider IDs are populated on claim forms, which is critical for accurate claims processing and streamlined billing. The report pulls provider details directly from the Provider Information dialog box, allowing for an up-to-date reference of key numbers and identification data associated with each provider. Additionally, it shows carrier details by referencing information from the Dental Insurance Plan Information dialog, ensuring that each insurance carrier linked to a provider is accurately represented. Provider ID details, including the specific code and number entered for each insurance carrier, are also part of the output, gathered from the Provider ID Setup dialog box. This integration of provider and carrier data helps maintain consistency across the system and can be invaluable when verifying information or troubleshooting claim discrepancies. Overall, the Provider IDs List is an important resource within Dentrix for maintaining accurate provider records, ensuring that the proper data is used in insurance claims, and supporting robust practice management.*|

It serves as an essential tool for verifying that all organizational data—including identification numbers, names, and other relevant details—has been accurately set up in the system. This ensures that every individual in your practice is correctly recorded, which is vital for both administrative oversight and auditing purposes. The report offers customization through filtering. Users can narrow down the list based on specific criteria such as clinic, provider identification, or even names and titles. This feature enables practices to quickly access and review a subset of the organization relevant to a particular query or operational need. Report generation is facilitated through DXOne Reporting. By navigating to the Reference folder within the reporting module and selecting the Practice Organization List, you can set the desired filtering options—such as choosing to display all clinics or only selected ones—before producing the final document, whether printed or digital. The Practice Organization List not only acts as a validation tool to confirm that provider information is current and correct, but it also plays a crucial role in streamlining administrative tasks and ensuring that records remain consistent during audits or organizational reviews.

It also provides details about the Medical Alert Name, appointment status types, and appointment checklist descriptions that are essential for daily operational workflows. By consolidating these various elements into one comprehensive document, the report acts as a critical reference tool, allowing practice administrators to confirm that all custom practice information is correct and up-to-date. This helps streamline workflows and supports consistent delivery of services by ensuring that the system settings align with your office’s operational and billing practices. Accessing the report is straightforward through the Office Manager, where selecting the appropriate option for Custom Practice Information will generate the latest details from your Dentrix setup. This process not only assists with regular audits but also aids in maintaining the overall integrity of your practice’s data as your operational needs evolve.*|

This streamlined process helps reduce manual follow‑ups, minimizes no‐show rates, and improves patient engagement by delivering timely communication. Because the exact configuration can vary depending on your Dentrix version and the auto dial solution you choose, referring to the official Dentrix documentation or consulting with your service provider is recommended for precise instructions.*|
|![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae20d9f5-e18a-4894-afb0-cb27b4e4f384)|`Auto Chart Number Setup`| *Auto Chart Setup allows practices to automatically generate chart numbers for patients, reducing duplicate entries and speeding up data entry. You can configure this in Office Manager > Maintenance > Practice Setup > Auto Chart Number Setup, where you can choose between numeric or alphanumeric formats. Numeric chart numbers are six-digit identifiers, while alphanumeric numbers combine the first two letters of a patient's last name with a unique four-digit ID. This setup ensures consistency and efficiency in patient record management.*|
|![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce205aef-32cc-4f85-b13c-309663836265)|`Report Fonts Setup`| *Report Fonts Setup allows you to customize the fonts used in reports and statements, ensuring consistency with your practice’s branding. You can modify font family, size, and style for headers, footers, subheaders, and body text. To access this feature, go to Office Manager > Maintenance > Practice Setup > Report Fonts Setup, where you can select a font type, adjust its style (bold, italic, etc.), and set the size from 8 to 72 points. It's recommended to keep font sizes similar to defaults to avoid layout issues in printed reports.*|
|![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3eb49e9-be04-4025-9b73-71e98639f56f)|`Network Setup`| *Network Setup ensures seamless connectivity between workstations and the server, allowing users to share data efficiently across the practice.

|![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e7db50c-66ba-4930-9841-f25214f337e8)|`Dentrix Server Administration Utility`| *The Dentrix Server Administration Utility is used to manage database exports and backups for Dentrix G5 and later versions. Since Dentrix stores data in an SQL database, this utility allows practices to schedule database exports, ensuring that backup software can properly save a copy of the database. The utility is located at C:\Program Files\Dentrix\_ServerAdmin.exe (or C:\Program Files (x86)\Dentrix\_ServerAdmin.exe on some systems). Users can configure scheduled exports by selecting specific days and times, helping maintain data integrity and recovery options in case of system failures.*|
|![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e79203b-318a-4722-8327-1841bd05d77b)|`Preferences`| *Preferences allow you to customize various settings to match your practice’s workflow. You can configure options related to general settings, printing, eligibility verification, statement forms, file paths, and database preferences. These settings help streamline daily operations by tailoring Dentrix to your specific needs. To access preferences, go to Office Manager > Maintenance > Practice Setup > Preferences, where you can adjust different categories to optimize efficiency.*|
|![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3879ee50-070a-472b-be57-316ce702b4b7)|`Workstation Setup`| *Workstation Setup allows you to configure individual workstation settings to ensure consistency across your practice. You can customize appointment book preferences, ledger colors, insurance payment settings, and other workstation-specific options. To set up a workstation, go to Office Manager > Maintenance > Practice Setup > Workstation Setup, where you can save and apply settings for different computers in your network. This helps streamline workflows and maintain uniform configurations across multiple workstations.*|

|![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b923f65-b09b-4d9f-9ceb-df4f7e810b3e)|`Task Schedule (Month-End)`| *Task Scheduler for Month-End automates routine tasks like closing the month, updating aging account balances, moving procedures and clinical notes to history, and resetting insurance benefits. This ensures accurate financial records and prevents manual errors. You can configure the scheduler in Office Manager > Maintenance > Task Scheduler (Month End) to run tasks on a set schedule, such as daily, weekly, or monthly. This helps streamline operations without needing to close Dentrix manually.*|
|![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae559b8b-f721-4aae-bdb3-ac9c5f96c49a)|`Audit Trail Report (Standard)`| *Audit Trail Report tracks changes made within the system, helping practices monitor financial transactions, patient modifications, appointment updates, and security-related actions. This report logs details such as the date, time, user, and type of change, ensuring transparency and fraud protection. It also includes sequential numbering to detect missing or altered reports. You can generate the Audit Trail Report in Office Manager > Maintenance > Audit Trail Report, where you can filter entries based on specific criteria.*|
|![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc5a0568-27c1-4fdf-b307-e9664b67b330)|`Audit Trail Report (Provider/Staff)`| *The Provider/Staff Audit Trail Report in Dentrix allows you to track changes related to provider and staff activations or inactivations within a selected date range. This report helps monitor personnel updates and provides fraud protection through sequential numbering, ensuring transparency in staff modifications. You can generate this report in Office Manager > Maintenance > Audit Trail Report (Prov/Staff), where you can filter entries based on specific criteria such as date, time, user, and type of change.*|
|![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ddf04353-f385-46a3-9939-1dc8bda0b7ac)|`Purge Exported Files`| *Purge Exported Files allows you to permanently delete exported data to maintain database efficiency and protect sensitive patient information. When you merge letters or export data from reports, Dentrix stores a log file of the export, which can accumulate over time and increase database size. Regular purging helps prevent unnecessary storage buildup. To purge exported files, go to Office Manager > Maintenance > Purge Exported Files, select the information you want to delete, and uncheck any items you wish to keep before confirming the purge.*|
|![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d44b2e71-a985-4729-8d22-cea1e40d0c05)|`Delete Finance Charges`| *In Dentrix, deleting finance charges allows you to remove incorrectly applied charges from patient accounts. If finance charges were posted by mistake, you can delete them for a specific date by going to Office Manager > Maintenance > Delete Finance Charges, entering the date, and confirming the deletion. This removes both manually and automatically applied charges, so it's recommended to print a Finance Charge Report beforehand to keep a record of correctly applied charges. If you need to delete charges for individual accounts, you can do so in the Ledger by double-clicking the finance charge and selecting Delete.*|
|![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a889766b-4cf4-4cd8-a853-a7c94aadccde)|`Delete Late Charge`| *In Dentrix, deleting late charges allows you to remove incorrectly applied charges from patient accounts. If you need to delete late charges for a specific date across multiple accounts, go to Ledger > Month End > Late Charge > Delete Late Charge, enter the date, and confirm the deletion. If you only need to remove late charges from individual accounts, open the Ledger, double-click the late charge, and click Delete. Keep in mind that late charges in closed months cannot be deleted.*|
