Instead of manually editing each patient record, this tool allows users to search for existing ZIP codes, area codes, or city names and apply updates efficiently. Users can modify ZIP codes or area codes for individual patients or apply changes to all affected records at once. The utility ensures that patient addresses remain accurate without requiring manual corrections for each entry*|
